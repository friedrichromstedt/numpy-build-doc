2010-10-14: Cython 0.13 Test py2.5
==================================

*   Testing Cython 0.13::

        python2.5 runtests.py 2>&1 | tee runtests.log

    One failure, looks like a Cython bug, and needs additional testing
    once numpy is compiled.  **Needs revision**

    Log files are lost together with the directory for unknown reason.
    Vincent?  **Needs revision**
